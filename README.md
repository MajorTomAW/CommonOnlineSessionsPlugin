# Enhanced Online Sessions Plugin

An Unreal Engine Plugin used to manage an online subsystem  
Developed in Unreal Engine 5.3. Works on any Unreal Engine 5 Version.

Tired of the _Advanced Sessions Plugin_?  
This is the new one!  
Much more modular and should work right out of the box.

EnhancedOnlineSessions Subsystem that helps communicating with the online service.  
Supports **STEAM**, **Epic Online Services** (EOS) and **EOS Plus**.  
Including platform specific settings which can be changed inside the ``Editor.``

Well my goal was to make this plugin as modular as possible that it works with any other project.  
The entire online service logic is stored into a custom ```UGameInstanceSubsystem.```

# 1.1 Configure your Project using the Online Subsystem of your Choice
In ``Project Settings > Plugins`` there is a section called ``Online Enhanced Subsystem.``  
  
![image](https://github.com/MajorTomAW/EnhancedOnlineSessions/assets/96875345/19cb6a21-84a1-4311-bea7-6760974f1d31)

Here you can select the Online Subsystem of your Choice and configure its parameters.  
This will write the changes directly into the ``DefaultEngine.ini`` so you wont have to do that manually anymore :)  

üìùYou will be prompted to restart the Editor after.

# 1.2 Structure of the Enhanced Sessions
üí°The Enhanced Sessions Subsystem follows a consistent structure.  
All the necessary functions are stored inside the ``EnhancedOnlineSubsystem``

These function will always take in a request which defines the action that you want to do.  
Every request will have multiple callabacks, based on the request type, that you can bind functions to.  
However, every request will have an ``OnFailedDelegate`` which will be called if the request fails and the log why the request may have failed will be passed through the delegate.


# 2.1 Online Sessions
To Host an Online Session you need to call the ``HostOnlineSession`` function which you can find in the ``EnhancedOnlineSubsystem``
This takes in a ``HostSessionRequest.`` There are two different types of session you can host:
